Cook some food
I decide I'm hungry so I go to the kitchen to make some food. I decide to make toast with jam. I go to the bread and take out two slices. I put the splices into the toaster and turn it on. When the toast is done I take it out and put it on the plate. Then I get the jam, open the jar and put jam on the toast with a knife.
