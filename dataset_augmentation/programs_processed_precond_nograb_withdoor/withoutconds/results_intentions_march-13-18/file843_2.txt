Make coffee
I walk into the kitchen. I find the coffee maker and open it. I find the coffee filter, grab it and put it into the coffee maker. I find ground coffee, grab it and put it into the coffee maker. I find some water, then I pour it into the coffee maker. I close the coffee maker, I plug it in and I switch it on.
