Wash dishes with dishwasher
First I walk to the kitchen. I go to the sink and rinse off the dishes in the sink. Then I open the dishwasher and place the cleaned off dishes into it. Next I find the dishwasher soap and put it into the dishwasher. Then I turn the dishwasher on and select some settings. Then I close the dishwasher and let it run.
