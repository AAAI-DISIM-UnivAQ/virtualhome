Brush teeth
I walk to the bathroom and approach the sink. I turn the faucet so the water is running and take my toothbrush and toothpaste. I squeeze toothpaste out of the tube onto the toothbrush, then I put it back and brush my teeth. Afterwards I rinse my mouth and toothbrush, turn the faucet again and put back the toothbrush.
