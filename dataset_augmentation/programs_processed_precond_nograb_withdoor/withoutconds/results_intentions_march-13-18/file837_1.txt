Wash teeth
I walk to the bathroom and find my toothbrush. I pick it up and find the toothpaste, then squeeze some toothpaste out onto the toothbrush. I then brush my teeth for a minute, first brushing the top row then the bottom row. I spit, find a cup, and rinse my mouth out. Then I turn the sink on and rinse my toothbrush. I put the toothpaste and toothbrush back where the belong.
