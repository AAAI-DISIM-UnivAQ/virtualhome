Cut toenails
First I sit in the middle of the bed. I out a towel on the bed where my foot will be to catch the toenail clippings. I start clipping the nails. When I am done clipping the nails, then I take the towel and roll it inwards so no clippings will fall out, and I take it to the garbage can and shake it out over the can so any stray clippings fall in the can.
