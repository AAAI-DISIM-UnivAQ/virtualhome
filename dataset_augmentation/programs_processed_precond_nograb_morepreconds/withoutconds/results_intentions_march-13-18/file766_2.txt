Wash teeth
I walk in to the bathroom. I turn on the faucet. I find the toothbrush and toothpaste. I grab the toothbrush and toothpaste. I rinse off the toothbrush. I add toothpaste to the toothbrush. I put back the toothpaste. I wash my teeth with the toothbrush. I rinse off the toothbrush. I put the toothbrush back. I rinse my mouth out. I turn the faucet off.
