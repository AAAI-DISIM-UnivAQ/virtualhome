Then turn cold nozzle on and increase until the water is warm but you can put your hands in it without burning them. Pick up the drain plug and plug the drain under dishes. Fill sink with warm water half way and add 1/2 tsp of soap then turn the water off. Open the rag drawer and get a rag. Wet the rag in the sink and wipe each dish one at a time on all sides until no food is left attached to the dish. Turn the hot water back on and rince each dish in the running water and place it in the drying rack to dry. Put each dish in the kitchen cubbard after it has dried.
