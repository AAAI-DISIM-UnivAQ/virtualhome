Make coffee
I go to the kitchen, I pour water in the kettle then I boil it. Then I pour the water into the coffee maker, then I put the coffee filter in the coffee maker. Then I put the ground coffee in. Then I close the lid of the coffee maker, and then I switch it on. And then I pour the water from the coffee maker into the coffee cup.
