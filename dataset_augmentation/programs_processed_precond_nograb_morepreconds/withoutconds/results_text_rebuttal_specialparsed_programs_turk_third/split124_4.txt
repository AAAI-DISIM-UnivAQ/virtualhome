Entertain
Occasionally during the evening (8:00 PM to 10:00 PM) I will entertain guests.  I will offer my guests coffee, tea or soda, and cookies or cake to eat.  I must prepare the coffee and tea by boiling the water, and use instant coffee or tea granules.  For this action, for my guests, I need to prepare coffee, tea, and/or soda, and cookies, and use napkins, plates, cups or glasses.
