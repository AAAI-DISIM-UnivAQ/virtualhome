Work
I go to my office. I switch the computer on and sit on the office chair. I look at the computer screen to see what needs to be done. I use my mouse to navigate to the relevant directory, then release it. I type code with my keyboard. When I'm done, I look at the computer again to evaluate what I've done. Then I switch off the computer using the mouse and put back the mouse.
